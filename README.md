# MSclassifier

MSclassifier is a python package that automatizes the creation of a classifier based on mutational signatures. Although this package was originaly developped to predict the Homologous Recombination (HR) status of high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), its applications extend far beyond. MSclassifier simplifies the process of extracting mutational signatures and training a neural network to produce a neural network together with a classification margin that can be easily exported to fit new data.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests
